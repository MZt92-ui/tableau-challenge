# Project: Citi Bike Program Pre-Covid-19 Performance Analysis
**The project was aimed to find patterns about how Citi Bikes Program was utilised before Covid-19 specifically in year 2019. The project was prepared for Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp study, with the purpose to apply python, tableau and statistical concepts for real-life datasets.**

## Citi Bike Program & Dataset
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the boroughs of New York City.
<br>The Citi Bike operator has made monthly riding records availble to the public in csv formats, which is accessible in [Link](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data). The information includes demographic entries, start & end stations, start & end time and etc.  

## Project Scope & Procedure
This project was to answer below questions:
1. Firstly, to understand overall performance of the program in year 2019, including total riding counts, riding time and etc.
2. Then to understand users' demographics
3. Lastly to reveal some users' behaviours and understand how the program was utilised

The key procedures are:
* **Data extraction & transformation:**
<br>There are some missing records related to station information; I left them blank without deletion and replacement as they are not wrong records, deletion would impact total counts; also there is no other information to support replacements of these non-numerical values. Then extract information of interets and combine 12 tables into one for further analysis. 
* **Visualisation & analysis using python**
* **Create a dashboard in tableau**

## Dashboard & Summary

## Key Analysis
### Analysis 1: Monthly Total Trips
Riding counts from customer & subscriber follow similar pattern, with an upward trend every month til September 2019 and then re

### Analysis 2: Top Age Groups utilising the program & their types (birth-year)

### Analysis 3: Gender & their types (gender)

Using behaviour: 
### Analysis 4: Peak starting hours for different age groups (starttime) (re dai tu)

### Analysis 5: Map of starting point for average & std of durations: showing each station with durations (trup duration)
